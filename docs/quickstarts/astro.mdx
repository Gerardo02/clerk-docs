# Use Clerk with Astro

Learn how to use Clerk to quickly and easily add secure authentication and user management to your Astro application.

<Steps>
### Install `@clerk/astro`

Clerk's Astro SDK has prebuilt components and helpers to make user authentication easier.

To get started using Clerk with Astro, add the SDK to your project:

<CodeBlockTabs type="installer" options={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm"]}>
  ```bash filename="terminal"
  npm install @astro/clerk
  ```

  ```bash filename="terminal"
  yarn add @astro/clerk
  ```

  ```bash filename="terminal"
  pnpm add @astro/clerk
  ```
</CodeBlockTabs>

### Set environment variables

Below is an example of your `.env` file.

**Pro tip!** If you are signed into your Clerk Dashboard, your secret key should become visible by clicking on the eye icon. Otherwise, you can find your keys in the Clerk Dashboard on the [API Keys](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys) page.

<InjectKeys>

```sh filename=".env"
PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY={{pub_key}}
CLERK_SECRET_KEY={{secret}}
```

</InjectKeys>

### Update `.env.d.ts`

Inside your `src/` directory, update the `.env.d.ts` file to ensure that the locals added by the middleware are properly typed.

```ts filename="src/.env.d.ts" {3}
/// <reference path="../.astro/types.d.ts" />
/// <reference types="astro/client" />
/// <reference types="@clerk/astro/env" />
```

### Update `astro.config.mjs`

To configure Clerk in your astro application, you will need to update your `astro.config.mjs`.

- Add the Clerk integration to the `integrations` list.
- Install the [`@astrojs/node`](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/node/) adapter. This is required for the middleware to work.
- Set `output` to `server`. This is required when deploying to a host supporting SSR.

```ts filename="astro.config.mjs" {2,3,6-8}
import { defineConfig } from "astro/config";
import node from "@astrojs/node";
import clerk from "@clerk/astro";

export default defineConfig({
  integrations: [clerk()],
  output: "server",
  adapter: node({ mode: "standalone" }),
});
```

### Add middleware to your application

[`clerkMiddleware()`](TODO) grants you access to user authentication state throughout your application, on any route or page. It also allows you to protect specific routes from unauthenticated users. To add `clerkMiddleware()` to your application, follow these steps:

1. Create a `middleware.ts` file inside your `src/` directory.
2. In your `middleware.ts` file, export an `onRequest` constant and assign it to the result of the `clerkMiddleware` function.

```tsx filename="src/middleware.ts"
import { clerkMiddleware } from "@clerk/astro/server";

export const onRequest = clerkMiddleware();
```

3. By default, `clerkMiddleware()` will not protect any routes. All routes are public and you must opt-in to protection for routes. See the [`clerkMiddleware()` reference](/docs/references/astro/clerk-middleware) to learn how to require authentication for specific routes.

### Add components to your app

Clerk offers components that allow you to protect your pages. These components are used to control the visibility of your pages based on the user's authentication state.

<CodeBlockTabs options={["Astro", "React"]}>
  ```astro filename="src/pages/index.astro"
  ---
  import { SignedIn, SignedOut } from '@clerk/astro/components/control'
  import { UserButton } from '@clerk/astro/components/interactive'
  import { SignInButton } from '@clerk/astro/components/unstyled'
  ---

  <SignedOut>
    <SignInButton />
  </SignedOut>
  <SignedIn>
    <UserButton />
  </SignedIn>
  ```

  ```tsx filename="src/pages/index.tsx"
  import {
    SignInButton,
    SignedIn,
    SignedOut,
    UserButton
  } from '@clerk/astro/client/react'

  export default function Page() {
    return (
      <>
        <SignedOut>
          <SignInButton />
        </SignedOut>
        <SignedIn>
          <UserButton />
        </SignedIn>
      </>
    )
  }
  ```
</CodeBlockTabs>

### Read session and user data

Clerk provides helpers that you can use to access the active session and user data in your Astro application.

This example uses the `auth()` local to validate an authenticated user and the  `currentUser()` local to access the `Backend API User` object for the authenticated user.

<CodeBlockTabs options={["Page component", "API Route"]}>

```astro filename="src/pages/me.astro"
---
if (!Astro.locals.auth().userId) {
  return Astro.redirect('/login');
}

const user = await Astro.locals.currentUser()
---

<div>{JSON.stringify(user)}</div>
```

```tsx filename="src/api/me.ts"
export async function GET({ locals }) {
  if (!locals.auth().userId) {
    new Response('Unauthorized', { status: 401 })
  }

  return new Response(JSON.stringify(await locals.currentUser()), {
    status: 200,
  });
};
```
</CodeBlockTabs>
